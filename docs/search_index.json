However, there are too many rows that have missing values. Therefore, we count missing values by month. December 2020 and Janurary 2021 have the greatest number of missing values. This is reasonable as vaccination just started and itâ€™s hard to get all data well-organized. 4.4 Heatmap "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
