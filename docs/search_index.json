We extracted whole country data and we can see that each row represents a day from 2020-12-20 to now. The information is updated everyday. There are lots of missing values in thie table and we are going to use different methods to visualize it. 4.2 Missing value counts by column ## num_missing ## daily_vaccinations_raw 36 ## people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred 35 ## people_fully_vaccinated 35 ## total_distributed 34 ## people_vaccinated 34 ## people_vaccinated_per_hundred 34 ## distributed_per_hundred 34 ## share_doses_used 34 ## total_vaccinations 21 ## total_vaccinations_per_hundred 21 ## daily_vaccinations 1 ## daily_vaccinations_per_million 1 ## date 0 ## location 0 This is the missing value counts by different features. 4.3 Missing value counts by row ## # A tibble: 9 x 2 ## date num_missing ## * &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020-12 109 ## 2 2021-01 125 ## 3 2021-02 11 ## 4 2021-05 10 ## 5 2021-06 1 ## 6 2021-07 11 ## 7 2021-09 21 ## 8 2021-10 21 ## 9 2021-11 11 Each row in the original dataframe represents a specific day. However, there are too many rows that have missing values. Therefore, we count missing values by month. December 2020 and Janurary 2021 have the greatest number of missing values. This is reasonable as vaccination just started and it’s hard to get all data well-organized. 4.4 Heatmap We can observe all rows that have missing values all at once by using this heatmap. However, as there are much more rows that don’t have missing value, we are not able to see the proportionas the map would be way too long. This missing value plot is a combination of all the information above. It consists of three plots. The main plot shows different patterns of all rows. The blue block represents missing value. The barplot on the right is the row count plot. It tells us the number of each patter. We can observe that complete cases is much more than missing cases. The barplot on the top is a visualization of 4.2. It shows how many rows contain missing values of different features. As there are not many missing rows, we might remove missing patter 2, 4, 5, and 7 as over 50% of the features are missing. For pattern 3 and 6, we can use mean or median to fill the missing values.
